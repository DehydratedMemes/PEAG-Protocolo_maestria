The energy transfer (ET) process’s emission intensities and Stern–Volmer constants (K               SV               ) showed that Ag NP’s presence increased ET’s efficiency. The molecular structures of TPPS, TPPS, and BVB/TPPS were optimized using the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G (d) technique to elucidate the mechanism. The discovered optimized molecular structure proved that whereas TPPS and BVB/TPPS MSs are not planar because the porphyrin group in TPPS is rotated out by phenyl sodium sulphate, the BVB MS is planer. All of the theoretical BVB results and the acquired experimental optical results were very similar.},

The influence of particle size of boron carbide (B4C) and the amount of titanium (Ti) on the TiC-TiB2 composites properties is explored. The structural features and crystalline structures of the prepared composites were systematically characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The influence of zirconia (ZrO2) additives on the mechanical properties of prepared composites is explored and explained. The obtained results reveal that ZrO2 additives have a significant influence on the mechanical properties of TiC-TiB2 composites. An addition of 20 wt\% ZrO2 results in a maximum enhancement of 1805 HV in comparison to 1683 HV for as-produced TiCTiB2 composite. Detailed thermodynamic study of the effect of ZrO2 on the combustion process is also presented. Our results provide novel insights into the fabrication of TiC-TiB2 – based composites, establishing for the first time the influence of zirconia additives on the mechanical properties of the resulting composites, opening new opportunities to develop advanced composites for structural applications.},

The stability of the scintillator constituents was determined through fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) as an multivariate analysis tool. By exposing the scintillator liquid to a well-known photon flux at 365 nm and by measuring the decay rate of the fluorescence shifters and the formation rate of their photochemical degradation products, we can place an upper limit on the acceptable photon flux as 1.38 ± 0.09 × 10               −11               photon mol L               −1               . Similarly, the oxidative stability of the scintillator liquid was determined by exposure to air at several elevated temperatures. Through measurement of the corresponding activation energy it was determined that the average oxygen concentration would have to be kept below 4.3–7.1 ppb               w               (headspace partial pressure below 24 ppm               v               ). On the other hand, the thermal stability of the scintillator cocktail in the absence of light and oxygen was remarkable and poses no concern to the SNO+ experiment.},

  abstract = {The climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) is used to identify reaction coordinates and to find saddle points representing transition states of reactions. It can make efficient use of parallel computing as the calculations of the discretization points, the so-called images, can be carried out simultaneously. In typical implementations, the images are distributed evenly along the path by connecting adjacent images with equally stiff springs. However, for systems with a high degree of flexibility, this can lead to poor resolution near the saddle point. By making the spring constants increase with energy, the resolution near the saddle point is improved. To assess the performance of this energy-weighted CI-NEB method, calculations are carried out for a benchmark set of 121 molecular reactions. The performance of the method is analyzed with respect to the input parameters. Energyweighted springs are found to greatly improve performance and result in successful location of the saddle points in less than a thousand energy and force evaluations on average (about a hundred per image) using the same set of parameter values for all of the reactions. Even better performance is obtained by stopping the calculation before full convergence and complete the saddle point search using an eigenvector following method starting from the location of the climbing image. This combination of methods, referred to as NEB-TS, turns out to be robust and highly efficient as it reduces the average number of energy and force evaluations down to a third, to 305. An efficient and flexible implementation of these methods has been made available in the ORCA software.},

For a given functional (except LSDA) Stuttgart-type quasi-relativistic effective core potentials and an all-electron scalar relativistic approach (ZORA) tend to produce very similar geometries. In contrast to the lighter congeners, LSDA affords reasonably accurate geometries of 5d-metal complexes, as it is among the functionals with the lowest mean and standard deviations from experiment. For this set the ranking of some other popular density functionals, ordered according to decreasing standard deviation, is BLYP {$>$} VSXC {$>$} BP86 ≈ BPW91 ≈ TPSS ≈ B3LYP ≈ PBE {$>$} TPSSh {$>$} B3PW91 ≈ B3P86 ≈ PBE hybrid.

Chem. 2007, 28,1531-1537) transition-metal complexes using all-electron scalar relativistic DFT calculations in addition to the published nonrelativistic and ECP results. For this combined test set comprising first-, second-, and third-row metal complexes, B3P86 and PBE hybrid are indicated to perform best. A remarkably consistent standard deviation of around 2 pm in metal-ligand bond distances is achieved over the entire set of d-block elements. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Exceptionally high surface areas can be achieved through the rational design of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials can be produced with outstanding magnetic, electrical, optical, mechanical, and catalytic properties that are substantially different from their bulk counterparts. The nanomaterial properties can be tuned as desired               via               precisely controlling the size, shape, synthesis conditions, and appropriate functionalization. This review discusses a brief history of nanomaterials and their use throughout history to trigger advances in nanotechnology development. In particular, we describe and define various terms relating to nanomaterials. Various nanomaterial synthesis methods, including top-down and bottom-up approaches, are discussed. The unique features of nanomaterials are highlighted throughout the review. This review describes advances in nanomaterials, specifically fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon quantum dots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanohorns, nanoporous materials, core–shell nanoparticles, silicene, antimonene, MXenes, 2D MOF nanosheets, boron nitride nanosheets, layered double hydroxides, and metal-based nanomaterials. Finally, we conclude by discussing challenges and future perspectives relating to nanomaterials.},

The glycolyzed products consist mostly of the PET monomer, bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, and the dimer, and after long reaction time (up to and longer than 8 h), an equilibrium is attained between these two species. No other higher PET oligomers were detected in the study. Of the four metal acetates (lead, zinc, cobalt, and manganese) tested, zinc acetate is the best in terms of the extent of depolymerization, that is, the relative amount of monomer formed. The presence of green pigment in one type of recycled PET apparently has no effects on the glycolysis reaction. Copyright © 1989 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Poly(ethylene terephthalate), more commonly known as PET in the packaging industry and generally referred to as ‘polyester‘ in the textile industry, is an indispensable material with immense applications owing to its excellent physical and chemical properties. On the other hand, due to its increasing consumption and non-biodegradability, PET waste disposal has created serious environmental and economic concerns. Thus, management of PET waste has become an important social issue. In view of the increasing environmental awareness in the society, recycling remains the most viable option for the treatment of waste PET. Among the various methods of PET recycling (primary or ‘in-plant’, secondary or mechanical, tertiary or chemical, quaternary involving energy recovery), only chemical recycling conforms to the principles of sustainable development because it leads to the formation of the raw materials from which PET is originally made. Chemical recycling utilizes processes such as hydrolysis, methanolysis, glycloysis, ammonolysis and aminolysis. In a large collection of researches for the chemical recycling of PET, the primary objective is to increase the monomer yield while reducing the reaction time and/or carrying out the reaction under mild conditions. Continuous efforts of researchers have brought great improvements in the chemical recycling processes. This paper reviews methods for the chemical recycling of PET with special emphasis on glycolytic depolymerization with ethylene glycol. It covers the researches, including the works by the authors, on various processes and introduces recent developments to increase monomer yield. Processes including suband supercritical, catalytic, and microwave-assisted depolymerization are discussed. This paper also presents the impact of the new technologies such as nanotechnology on the future developments in the chemical recycling of PET.},

  abstract = {1. The pathophysiology of chronic arm oedema after treatment of breast cancer was investigated by collecting serum and subcutaneous interstitial fluid from the affected and contralateral arms by the wick method (both arms) and by aspiration (oedematous arm). The fluids were analysed for total protein, albumin, glycosaminoglycan and viscosity, and arm volume was measured.             2. Total protein concentration in the aspirated oedema fluid was 32.4 + 7.5 g/l (mean + SD throughout; n = 39). Protein concentration in wick fluid from the oedematous arm (35.8 + 7.3 g/l, n = 14) was not significantly different from that in aspirated fluid. The oedema protein concentrations were significantly lower than in wick fluid from the non-swollen arm (41.4 + 6.7 cmH2O, n = 13, P \&lt;0.01, analysis of variance). This was surprising in view of the common assumption that, the condition being of lymphatic origin, the oedema protein concentration should be raised.             3. The ratio of aspirate protein concentration to serum protein concentration showed a weak but highly significant negative correlation with the percentage increase in arm volume (r = −0.47, n = 35, P \&lt;0.005), again in contrast to conventional expectation. The demonstration of a reduced protein concentration in the swollen arm did not therefore depend solely on a comparison with the wick control results. The volume increased by on average 33\% and the ratio of aspirate protein concentration to serum protein concentration averaged 0.52 + 0.11 on the swollen side and 0.64 + 0.13 on the unaffected side.             4. Serum protein concentration in the patients with arm swelling (61.2 + 4.9 g/l) was significantly lower than that in postmastectomy patients without this complication (65.0 + 6.2 g/l). Most of the decrease occurred in the albumin fraction (oedema patients, 383 + 5.1 g/l; control patients, 42.0 + 2.1 g/l). In oedema patients receiving the anti-oestrogen tamoxifen serum albumin concentration was on average 23 g/l lower than in oedema patients not under medication (P \&lt;0.05, t-test).             5. Glycosaminoglycan concentration in oedema fluid was 0.8 +0.14 g/l (n = 21) and 75\% was sulphated. Along with the plasma protein this raised the relative viscosity of the fluid to 1.34 + 0.16 (n = 11).             6. The reduction in interstitial protein concentration in the swollen arm, contrary to expectation in lymph-oedema, could be explained in several ways. One possible hypothesis in light of reported haemodynamic abnormalities in such arms is that capillary pressure rises, increasing capillary filtration rate. We conclude that the pathophysiology of postmastectomy oedema involves additional factors besides axillary node trauma, and we suggest that input (filtration) as well as output (lymph flow) requires evaluation.},

However, some FSFs are less useful for medical applications because they are derived from toxic compounds. Here we report for the first time a fast (∼20 min), ultrasonic assisted, eco-friendly synthesis of four fluorescent organotin Schiff compounds using the corresponding aldehyde, benzoic hydrazide, and diorganotin oxide (               1               : MeO-L-SnPh               2               ,               2               :               t               Bu               2               -L-SnPh               2               ,               3               : HO-L-SnPh               2               , and               4               : HO-L-SnBu               2               ). These compounds were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy (               1               H,               13               C, and               119               Sn), HRMS, and UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy.

The as-prepared organotin Schiff compounds exhibit fluorescence at ambient temperature with good photophysical properties (fluorescence quantum yields               Φ               : 18–55\%). These organotin compounds serve as fluorescent dyes in silk fibroin (               Bombyx mori               ). The organotin dyed fluorescent silk fibroin showed a uniform staining, high viability, and good capacity to retain organotin compounds which might be used as innocuous scaffolds in tissue engineering.},

  abstract = {Multicomponent reactions, conducted in a domino, sequential or consecutive fashion, have not only considerably enhanced synthetic efficiency as one-pot methodology, but they have also become an enabling tool for interdisciplinary research. The highly diversity-oriented nature of the synthetic concept allows accessing huge structural and functional space. Already some decades ago this has been recognized for life sciences, in particular, lead finding and exploration in pharma and agricultural chemistry. The quest for novel functional materials has also opened the field for diversity-oriented syntheses of functional π-systems, i.e. dyes for photonic and electronic applications based on their electronic properties. This review summarizes recent developments in MCR syntheses of functional chromophores highlighting syntheses following either the framework forming scaffold approach by establishing connectivity between chromophores or the chromogenic chromophore approach by               de novo               formation of chromophore of interest. Both approaches warrant rapid access to molecular functional π-systems, i.e. chromophores, fluorophores, and electrophores for various applications.},

In this limit the excited states and ionization processes assume a molecular-like character. However, diffraction of bonding electrons by the periodic lattice potential remains of paramount importance in the crystallite electronic structure. Schrödinger’s equation is solved at the same level of approximation as used in the analysis of bulk crystalline electron-hole states (Wannier excitons). Kinetic energy is treated by the effective mass approximation, and the potential energy is due to high frequency dielectric solvation by atomic core electrons. An approximate formula is given for the lowest excited electronic state energy. This expression is dependent upon bulk electronic properties, and contains no adjustable parameters. The optical f number for absorption and emission is also considered. The same model is applied to the problem of two conduction band electrons in a small crystallite, in order to understand how the redox potential of excess electrons depends upon crystallite size.},

When the calculated geometries were compared with the X-ray structure determination for the analogous complex with permethylated cyclopentadienyl, it was found that in all cases the coordination mode of the n3-allyl was very poorly described, despite the functional used. The Ru-C bond distance corresponding to the substituted alryl carbon was overestimated by 0.23-0.50 Å, depending on the functional and the basis set used. These results were reproduced by further testing carried out with the ADF program and larger basis sets. MP2 leads to an acceptable value for the same Ru-C distance, with an underestimation of 0.07 Å, suggesting that, at least in the case of the functionals tested, DFT does not provide an accurate description of a weak Ru-C interaction. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {One-pot microwave synthesized organotin compound has been employed as good electro-acceptor (EA) and cheap for organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells.           ,                             Four organotin compounds bearing Schiff bases were prepared               via               a multicomponent microwave-assisted reaction among 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, 2-aminophenol derivatives and the corresponding diorganotin oxide (R               2               SnO, R =               n               Bu or Ph), with high yields and a low economic/environmental impact. All of the compounds were fully characterized by NMR (               1               H,               13               C, and               119               Sn) spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. All of the compounds absorb in the visible region around 480–490 nm, close to the maximum solar emission, with an optical band gap of around 2.3 eV and low fluorescence quantum yields. According to the electrochemical study, they present LUMO values close to that of [6,6]-phenyl-C               61               -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM-C               60               ), a typical electron acceptor organic photovoltaic material. Based on this combined optical/electrochemical study and as it allows the preparation of homogeneous spun films, the               n               -butyltin complex with carboxylic acid was selected for the investigation of its possible photovoltaic properties in organic solar cells. Charge photogeneration was obtained only using this organotin compound as an electron acceptor material with poly(3-hexylthiophene, P3HT) (typical electron donor material) with an open circuit voltage of 300 mV, a short-circuit current density of 0.11 mA cm               −2               and an efficiency of 5.2 × 10               −3               \%. Despite the fact that the efficiency is much lower with respect to the reference device P3HT/PCBM-C               60               , this preliminary result suggests that, after chemical and device processing optimization, tin complexes with Schiff bases could be applied as electron acceptor materials in organic photovoltaic devices.},

The resulting BOSCHIBAs were characterized by NMR (1H, 13C, and 11B), FTIR, and atmospheric pressure ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. BOSCHIBA1a was structurally characterized by single-crystal. Structure analysis indicates that the boron atom adopts a tetrahedral molecular geometry into a six-membered ring with a half-chair conformation. BOSCHIBAs 1a-3a and their ligands 1-3 exhibit relatively low quantum yields in a range from 1 to 3\%. In a bioimaging study by using the BOSCHIBAs 2a, and 3a as fluorescent staining dyes, those materials showed enhanced features in terms of low cytotoxicity, simple synthesis, photostability, hydrolytic stability and specific staining for cytoplasm structures.},

  abstract = {The crystal structure of polyethylene terephthalate (Terylene) has been determined by the interpretation of the X-ray diffraction patterns given by drawn fibres. The unit cell, which contains one chemical unit, —CO.C               6               H               4               .CO.O.(CH               2               )               2               O—, is triclinic, with               a               = 4.56Å,               b               = 5.94 Å,               c               = 10.75 Å,               α               = 98 1/2°,               β               = 118°,               γ               = 112°. This gives the density of the crystals as 1.455 g/cm               3               . If it is assumed that the density of amorphous regions in partly crystalline material is the same as that of the entirely amorphous material (1.335), the proportion by weight of crystals in ordinary drawn yarn (density 1.39) is 48\%, and in specimens of the highest recorded density (1.41) it is 64.5\%. These figures are, however, lower limits; if, as is likely, the density of amorphous regions in partly crystalline specimens is lower than 1.335, the proportions of crystalline material are higher than the figures given. The positions of atoms in the crystals have been deduced from the relative intensities of X-ray diffractions; approximate positions were found by trial-and-error methods, and refinement was then effected by calculations of electron densities, using the three-dimensional Fourier synthesis method. The molecules are nearly planar in configuration. Distances between atoms in neighbouring molecules are all normal Van der Waals contact distances; there is therefore no structural evidence for any unusually strong forces between the molecules. This conclusion is in agreement with that based on an estimate of the cohesion energy, which is very nearly the same as that of a comparable aliphatic polyester, polyethylene adipate. The high melting-point of polyethylene terephthalate in comparison with aliphatic polyesters is therefore not due to strong forces between the molecules; it is attributed to the O— ∕ rigidity of the aromatic ring with its attached —C groups. ∖∖ O In most drawn fibres of this polymer, the crystals do not have their c-axes (those parallel to the chain molecules) exactly parallel to the fibre axes; they are tilted in a precisely defined crystallographic direction, such that the 530 plane remains vertical and the inclination of the 001 plane to the fibre axis increases. This is especially well defined in fibres heated to 210° C and allowed to relax, the tilt angle being then about 5°. In principle it is expected that polymer crystals of triclinic symmetry would be tilted, but it is not clear what determines the crystallographic direction of tilt. Tilted crystal X-ray diffraction photographs played an important part in the structure determination.},

Methodological aspects of reference data generation, representation, and regression, as well as the question of how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically discussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions in chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in the field. A vision is outlined for the development of the methodology in the years to come.},

Especially in the energy sector, nanomaterials (mainly, carbon- and metal oxide/hydroxide-based nanomaterials) have contributed significantly. Among the various green approaches for the synthesis of these nanomaterials, the microwave-assisted approach has attracted significant research interest worldwide. In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that because of their enhanced surface area, high conducting nature, and excellent electrical and electrochemical properties, carbon nanomaterials are being extensively utilized as efficient electrode materials for both supercapacitors and secondary batteries. In this review article, we briefly demonstrate the characteristics of microwave-synthesized nanomaterials for next-generation energy storage devices. Starting with the basics of microwave heating, herein, we illustrate the past and present status of microwave chemistry for energy-related applications, and finally present a brief outlook and concluding remarks. We hope that this review article will positively convey new insights for the microwave synthesis of nanomaterials for energy storage applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Cutinases are promising agents for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bio-recycling because of their ability to produce the PET monomer terephthalic acid with high efficiency under mild reaction conditions. In this study, we found that the low-crystallinity PET (lcPET) hydrolysis activity of thermostable cutinase from               Thermobifida fusca               (TfCut2), was increased by the addition of cationic surfactant that attracts enzymes near the lcPET film surface via electrostatic interactions. This approach was applicable to the mutant TfCut2 G62A/F209A, which was designed based on a sequence comparison with PETase from               Ideonella sakaiensis               . As a result, the degradation rate of the mutant in the presence of cationic surfactant increased to 31\,±\,0.1 nmol min               −1               cm               −2               , 12.7 times higher than that of wild-type TfCut2 in the absence of surfactant. The long-duration reaction showed that lcPET film (200 μm) was 97\,±\,1.8\% within 30\,h, the fastest biodegradation rate of lcPET film thus far. We therefore believe that our approach would expand the possibility of enzyme utilization in industrial PET biodegradation.},

Both organoboron esters were fully characterized by NMR, vibrational absorption analysis, UV-vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The               δ               11               B of the new organoboron esters 4a and 4b evidenced the formation of the N→B coordination bond and the high-resolution mass spectrometry corroborates the presence of a boron atom in their molecular structure. The photophysical properties of CHCl               3               were analyzed by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy revealing that both materials can be classified as semiconductors with a fluorescence quantum yield of around 1\%. Furthermore, the nitro-substituted ester 4b demonstrated to be 1.5 times more potent against MDA-MB-231 (IC               50               = 13 μM) than damnacanthal 1 (IC               50               = 23 μM) with a low selectivity index (1.075). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on new nitro-substituted organoboron esters based on damnacanthal as a biological building block and applied against MDA-MBA-231 breast cancer cells.},

The synthesis of their ligands ((E)-1-(((2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)imino)methyl)naphthalen-2-ol and (E)-1(((2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)imino)methyl)naphthalen-2-ol) is also reported. The chemical structure of all the compounds has been established by nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C, and 119Sn), infrared spectroscopy, and high resolution mass spectrometry. The 12-nitroanalogue was characterized by singlecrystal X-ray structural analysis. The structure indicates that the backbone is essentially planar and the metal center resides in trigonal bipyramid geometry. The photophysical properties of the imines and those of the tin complexes were determined in solution exhibiting quantum yields around 4\% with lifetimes in the range 10À10À10À11 s. In a preliminary study, a diode was fabricated by a spun film of the 12-nitroanalogue, the device showed intrinsic electroluminescence properties with a threshold voltage at 13 V, a high current density (500 mA/cm2) but a low luminance (0.03 cd/m2).},

The glycolysis reactions were carried out at the boiling point of ethylene glycol under nitrogen atmosphere up to 10 h. Influences of the reaction time, volume of EG, catalysts and their concentrations on the yield of the glycolysis products were investigated. The glycolysis products were analysed for hydroxyl and acid values and identified by different techniques, such as HPLC, 1H NMR and 13C NMR, mass spectra, and DSC. It was found that the glycolysis products consist mainly of bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate [BHET] monomer ({$>$}75\%) which was effectively separated from dimer in quite pure crystalline form. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The relations between membrane cholesterol content, basal (unstimulated) transmembrane 45Ca2+ movements, cytosolic calcium levels, and membrane fluidity were investigated in cultured rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and isolated SMC plasma membrane microsomes. SMCs were enriched with unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) for 18-24 hours with medium containing human low density lipoprotein and FC-rich phospholipid (PL) liposomes. This procedure increased cholesterol mass without affecting PL mass, resulting in an increase in the FC/PL molar ratio compared with controls in cells (67\% FC increase, p less than 0.001; 43\% FC/PL ratio increase, p less than 0.01) and in SMC microsomes (52\% FC increase, p less than 0.05; 43\% FC/PL ratio increase, p less than 0.05). Cholesterol enrichment also increased unstimulated 45Ca2+ influx (p less than 0.001) and efflux (p less than 0.05). Cellular cholesterol content correlated in a linear fashion with these changes (influx: r = 0.722, p less than 0.01; efflux: r = 0.951, p less than 0.05). In addition, cytosolic calcium levels increased approximately 34\% (p less than 0.01) with cholesterol enrichment. The cholesterol-induced increase in 45Ca2+ influx was reversible with time and demonstrated sensitivity to the channel blockers. Fluorescence anisotropy measured from 5 degrees C to 40 degrees C using the fluorophore diphenylhexatriene showed decreased membrane fluidity in microsomal membranes obtained from cholesterol-enriched SMCs compared with controls (p less than 0.02). These results suggest that the SMC plasma membrane is very sensitive to cholesterol enrichment with liposomes or human low density lipoprotein and that increases in membrane cholesterol content increase cytosolic calcium levels in SMCs, are associated with a decrease in membrane fluidity, and unmask a new, or otherwise silent, dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel that may be involved in altered arterial wall properties with serum hypercholesterolemia.},

In particular, we discuss feature representation of molecular systems and present state-of-the-art algorithms of dimensionality reduction, density estimation, and clustering, and kinetic models. We divide our discussion into self-contained sections, each discussing a specific method. In each section, we briefly touch upon the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of the method, highlight its strengths and limitations, and describe the specific ways in which it has been used-or can be used-to analyze molecular simulation data.},

  abstract = {Mean-field electronic structure methods like Hartree−Fock, semilocal density functional approximations, or semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) theories do not account for long-range electron correlation (London dispersion interaction). Inclusion of these effects is mandatory for realistic calculations on large or condensed chemical systems and for various intramolecular phenomena (thermochemistry). This Review describes the recent developments (including some historical aspects) of dispersion corrections with an emphasis on methods that can be employed routinely with reasonable accuracy in large-scale applications. The most prominent correction schemes are classified into three groups: (i) nonlocal, density-based functionals, (ii) semiclassical C6-based, and (iii) one-electron effective potentials. The properties as well as pros and cons of these methods are critically discussed, and typical examples and benchmarks on molecular complexes and crystals are provided. Although there are some areas for further improvement (robustness, many-body and short-range effects), the situation regarding the overall accuracy is clear. Various approaches yield long-range dispersion energies with a typical relative error of 5\%. For many chemical problems, this accuracy is higher compared to that of the underlying mean-field method (i.e., a typical semilocal (hybrid) functional like B3LYP).},

In this study, the influence of solvent polarity and viscosity on several representative TICT compounds (three Coumarin derivatives, 4,4-dimethylaminobenzonitrile DMABN, 9-(dicyanovinyl)-julolidine DCVJ), was examined. While solvent polarity caused a bathochromic shift of peak emission in all compounds, this shift was lowest in the case of molecular rotors. Peak intensity was influenced strongly by solvent viscosity in DMABN and the molecular rotors, but polarity and viscosity influences cannot be separated with DMABN. Coumarins, on the other hand, did not show viscosity sensitivity. This study shows the unique suitability of molecular rotors as fluorescent viscosity sensors.},

  abstract = {Chemical compound space (CCS), the set of all theoretically conceivable combinations of chemical elements and (meta-)stable geometries that make up matter, is colossal. The first-principles based virtual sampling of this space, for example, in search of novel molecules or materials which exhibit desirable properties, is therefore prohibitive for all but the smallest subsets and simplest properties. We review studies aimed at tackling this challenge using modern machine learning techniques based on (i) synthetic data, typically generated using quantum mechanics based methods, and (ii) model architectures inspired by quantum mechanics. Such Quantum mechanics based Machine Learning (QML) approaches combine the numerical efficiency of statistical surrogate models with an ab initio view on matter. They rigorously reflect the underlying physics in order to reach universality and transferability across CCS. While state-of-the-art approximations to quantum problems impose severe computational bottlenecks, recent QML based developments indicate the possibility of substantial acceleration without sacrificing the predictive power of quantum mechanics.},

All compounds were fully characterized by NMR (1H, 11B, and 13C), IR, UV/vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The crystal structures of 3 and 4 showed tetracoordinated boron atoms with semiplanar skeleton ligands. The free rotation of the fluorescent molecular rotor, only observed in the binuclear compound, was decreased with increasing viscosity, while the quantum yield was increased. Interestingly, the property of reversible thermochromism was found in organoboron 4 in the solid state. DFT calculations to determine the both complexes have free rotation around the CPh−B1 bond. The boron compounds 3 and 4 have shown low cytotoxicity activity in cell line A-431 and low green staining in cells.},

In addition, the composition of two-phase alloys was analyzed using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). Heat treatment above 1500 °C was conducted in a high-frequency induction heating furnace, where the temperature was estimated by a two-color pyrometer with an accuracy of ± 20 °C. The melting point of pure Cr was determined to be 1861 ± 3 °C, considering the O and N impurities. The phase diagram of the Cr-Si system was determined in the whole composition range. The invariant reaction related to the formation of Cr3Si and Cr5Si3 phases was confirmed as the eutectic reaction of liquid \$ Cr3Si ? Cr5Si3. The solubility range of Cr3Si phase is on the Cr-rich side from the stoichiometric composition, whereas the solubility range of Cr5Si3 phase extends toward the Si-rich side. We found using the x-ray diffraction that the a-Cr5Si3/b-Cr5Si3 transformation does not exist.},

  abstract = {A novel application of fluorescent organotin compounds derived from Schiff bases was developed for imaging cells.           ,                             A series of eight new organotin compounds derived from Schiff bases has been prepared by a multicomponent reaction from 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde or 4-substituted-2-hydroxybenzalhedyde, benzhydrazine, and the corresponding diorganotin oxide (R               2               SnO, R =               n               Bu or Ph). All of the compounds were fully characterized by NMR (               1               H,               13               C, and               119               Sn), IR, UV/vis, elemental analyses and fluorescence spectroscopy. The crystal structures for some organotin compounds were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All of the compounds display fluorescence at room temperature with quantum yields of about 2 × 10               −4               to 0.56. The cytotoxic activity and cellular imaging studies were carried out with the newly synthesized compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of organotin compounds with Schiff base ligands investigated for fluorescence bioimaging (FBI).},

  abstract = {Although fire is now rarely used in synthetic chemistry, it was not until Robert Bunsen invented the burner in 1855 that the energy from this heat source could be applied to a reaction vessel in a focused manner. The Bunsen burner was later superseded by the isomantle, oil bath, or hot plate as a source for applying heat to a chemical reaction. In the past few years, heating and driving chemical reactions by microwave energy has been an increasingly popular theme in the scientific community. This nonclassical heating technique is slowly moving from a laboratory curiosity to an established technique that is heavily used in both academia and industry. The efficiency of “microwave flash heating” in dramatically reducing reaction times (from days and hours to minutes and seconds) is just one of the many advantages. This Review highlights recent applications of controlled microwave heating in modern organic synthesis, and discusses some of the underlying phenomena and issues involved.},

There is a need for water-soluble receptors that selectively bind kynurenic acid, allowing for detection and quantification. We report here the high-affinity binding of kynurenic acid in aqueous media to a resorcinarene salt receptor decorated with four flexible naphthalene groups at the upper rim. Experimental results from               1               H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, and electronic absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies all support high-affinity binding and selectivity for kynurenic acid over tryptophan. The measured binding constant (               K               = 1.46 ± 0.21 × 10               5               M               −1               ) is one order of magnitude larger than that observed with other resorcinarene receptors. The present host–guest system can be employed for sensory recognition of kynurenic acid. Computational studies reveal the key role of a series of cooperative attractive intra- and inter-molecular interactions contributing to an optimal binding process in this system.},

Herein, we introduce a push–pull boron-containing (dioxaborine) dye that presents unique spectroscopic behavior combining solvatochromism and molecular rotor properties. Indeed, in organic solvents, it shows strong red shifts in the absorption and fluorescence spectra upon increase in solvent polarity, which is typical for push–pull dyes. On the other hand, in polar solvents, where it probably undergoes twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), the dye displays strong dependence of its quantum yield on solvent viscosity, in accordance with the Förster–Hoffmann equation. In comparison to solvatochromic and molecular rotor dyes, the dioxaborine derivative shows an exceptional extinction coefficient (120\,000 M               −1               cm               −1               ), high fluorescence quantum yields and a red/far-red operating spectral range. It also displays much higher photostability in apolar media as compared to Nile Red, a fluorogenic dye of similar color. Its reactive carboxyl derivative has been successfully grafted to carbetocin, a ligand of the oxytocin G protein-coupled receptor. This conjugate exhibits a {$>$}1000-fold turn on between apolar 1,4-dioxane and water. It targets specifically the oxytocin receptor at the cell surface, which enables receptor imaging with excellent signal-to-background ratio ({$>$}130). We believe that the presented push–pull dioxaborine dye opens a new page in the development of fluorogenic probes for bioimaging applications.},

The synthesis of a series of such systems and their borondifluoride complexes is described. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of difluorodioxaborine species were investigated as a function of the nature of electron donor and acceptor groups appended at either terminal positions of the molecular backbone. The emissive character of these dipolar dyes was attributed to an intraligand charge transfer process, leading to fluorescence emission that is strongly dependent on solvent polarity. Quasi-quantitative quenching of fluorescence in high polarity solvents was attributed to photoinduced electron transfer. These dyes were shown to behave as versatile fluorophores. Indeed, they display efficient two-photon excited fluorescence emission leading to high two-photon brightness values. Furthermore, they form nanoparticles in water whose fluorescence emission quantum yield is less than that of the dye in solution, owing to aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching. When cos7 living cells were exposed to these weakly-emitting nanoparticles, one- and two-photon excited fluorescence spectra showed a strong emission within the cytoplasm that originated from the individual molecules. Dye uptake thus involved a disaggregation mechanism at the cell membrane which restored fluorescence emission. This off–on fluorescence switching allows a selective optical monitoring of those molecules that do enter the cell, which offers improved sensitivity and selectivity of detection for bioimaging purposes.},

None of the functionals considered accounts successfully for the dispersion interaction. The Becke exchange and the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (B-LYP) exchange-correlation functionals yield a purely repulsive potential after counterpoise correction. The Dirac-Slater (D-S) functional gives minima which are too deep, at internuclear distances which are too short, particularly for He2 and Ne2. The experimental repulsive potential is reproduced best by D-S calculations while the B-LYP results are close to the SCF ones. © 1994.},

  abstract = {Ab initio calculations rest on solving the Schr€odinger equation; the nature of the necessary approximations determines the level of the calculation. In the simplest approach, the Hartree–Fock method, the total molecular wavefunction C is approximated as a Slater determinant composed of occupied spin orbitals. To use these in practical calculations the spatial orbitals are approximated as a linear combination (a weighted sum) of basis functions. Electron correlation methods are also discussed. The main uses of the ab initio method are calculating molecular geometries, energies, vibrational frequencies, spectra, ionization potentials and electron affinities, and properties like dipole moments which are connected with electron distribution. These calculations find theoretical and practical applications, since, for example, enzyme–substrate interactions depend on shapes and charge distributions, reaction equilibria and rates depend on energy differences, and spectroscopy plays an important role in identifying and understanding novel molecules. The visualization of calculated phenomena can be very important in interpreting results.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Gold nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be efficient catalysts for a wide range of reactions in the past decades, such as oxidation and hydrogenation. In recent research, gold nanoparticle catalysts have been utilized in carbon-carbon coupling reactions. These coupling reactions have been established as convenient and general approaches toward biaryl or propargylamines, which are biologically active compounds, natural products, and pharmaceutical organic compounds. This review aims to highlight the current achievements in the field of gold nanoparticle-catalyzed coupling reactions, including Ullmann homocoupling of halides, oxidative homocoupling of organoboronates, Suzuki cross-coupling of phenylboronic acid and halides, Sonogashira cross-coupling of iodobenzene and phenylacetylene, and A               3               -coupling reaction of phenylacetylene, amines, and aryl or alkyl aldehydes. The catalytic mechanisms of these carbon-carbon coupling reactions are discussed. Finally, we provide our perspectives on some future work on gold nanocatalysis in coupling reactions.},

One of the differences between normal and cancer cells is the intracellular pH. Therefore, the design and synthesis of pH-responsive fluorescent materials are required. Organotin Schiff bases showed halofluorochromic behavior in solution. Microwave-assisted synthesis showed better reaction times and chemical yields compared with conventional heating. All compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques. The halofluorochromism study showed that some molecules in acidic media have the maximum luminescence intensity due to protonation. All the fluorescent tin complexes showed cell staining on hepatocyte and MCF-7 cells by confocal microscopy. The theoretical study has enabled us to rationalize the optical properties and the halofluorochromism for compounds 1 and 2 synthesized in this work. Our results showed that the emission decrease, in the acid and basic media for compounds 1 and 2, respectively, is caused by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) deactivation.},

Commercial biomarkers are available; however, some disadvantages exist like high isolation cost, low-temperature storage, photodegradation, and low yields. Here two new fluorescent molecular rotors (SB-B 2 and SB-B2 3) derived from Boron Schiff bases (BOSCHIBAs) were synthesized and characterized by NMR (               1               H and               13               C), UV/Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy.

Both compounds showed viscochromic and thermochromic properties. The binuclear rotor 3 showed a greater luminescence intensity increase than the mononuclear one at the highest level of viscosity (90\%). From the remarkable findings and to our best knowledge this is the first time low cytotoxicity BOSCHIBAs exhibit selective fluorescent staining of endoplasmic reticulum in HeLa cells and HUVECs.},

In this work, we propose a novel definition of bond order, called Laplacian bond order (LBO), which is defined as a scaled integral of negative parts of Laplacian of electron density in fuzzy overlap space. Many remarkable features of LBO are exemplified by numerous structurally diverse molecules. It is shown that LBO has a direct correlation with the bond polarity, the bond dissociation energy and the bond vibrational frequency. The dissociation behavior of LBO of the N-N bond in N2 has been studied. Effects of the basis sets, theoretic methods and geometrical conformations on LBO have also been investigated. Through comparisons, we discussed in details similarities and discrepancies among LBO, Mayer bond order, natural localized molecular orbital bond order, fuzzy overlap population and electron density at bond critical points.},

The frontier molecular orbitals and NBO charges indicate that the intramolecular benzene ring in the BFP molecule can inhibit the charge redistribution after photo-excitation effectively. The substitution of malonic and malononitrile groups can create the fluorescence quenching phenomenon, which may be caused by their participation in the excited state charge redistribution and act as important electron-donating groups. Also, these substitutions can enhance the configuration stability in the S               1               state and hinder the formation of a metastable structure. The malononitrile group substitution can significantly decrease the energy barrier in the S               1               state and promote proton transfer.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the performance of eight popular density functionals, four of which are "standard" functionals not including dispersion (B3LYP, BP86, PBE, and TPSS) and four of which have been constructed to account for dispersion (B97D, wB97XD, M06, and M06L), in reproducing 18 molecular structures derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments on ruthenium-based olefin metathesis catalyst precursors. Our analysis of all the internuclear distances reveals that standard DFT predicts systematically expanded structures. In contrast, all the methods accounting for dispersion give rise to more compact structures, removing the systematic overestimation of internuclear distances. The contracting effect of dispersion is general and also affects chemical bonds, thus reducing the general overestimation of bond lengths. The best overall performance is observed for wB97XD, which offers relatively small statistical errors when considering the overall structure as well as selected distances. Only for the coordination center geometry is the accuracy of wB97XD matched by standard functionals such as PBE and TPSS, whereas M06 and M06L are associated with larger errors. At the other end of the scale, B3LYP is seen to give the largest statistical errors in general, both when considering the complete structures and the geometries of the coordination centers alone. For the organic ligands, however, B3LYP performs clearly better than the other standard functionals although not as well as the functionals accounting for dispersion. Extending the basis sets is seen to improve the structures in particular of the coordination center, thus underlining the importance of using sufficiently flexible basis sets if highly accurate geometries are to be obtained. Similar conclusions to those obtained for the ruthenium catalysts can be drawn from comparisons of the X-ray crystal structures of 10 other organometallic complexes of relevance to homogeneous catalysis, covering first (Ti, Fe, Co, Ni), second (Zr, Mo, Rh, Pd) and third (W, Ir) row transition metals, with those of DFT. The latter analyses thus offer a first indication that the picture obtained for the ruthenium alkylidene complexes may be extended to other classes of relatively large transition metal complexes. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

It emphasizes the link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry, and their mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions and the most promising research directions in the field.},

  abstract = {Insulin resistance is very common in the elderly, and may be associated with glucose intolerance or frank diabetes. In previous studies we demonstrated that insulin resistance in old Wistar rats is associated with decreased autophosphorylation and activation of the hepatic insulin receptor kinase (IRK) in vivo. We now show that this defect can be reproduced in vitro, where the extent of insulin-induced activation of IRK in liver membranes of old rats was decreased by approximately 50\% compared with young controls. The defect could be largely abolished after solubilization of the membranes with Triton X-100. We also show that: (a) the viscosity of membranes from the old rats was significantly (P \&lt; 0.001, n = 4) higher (by 15\%) compared with young controls; (b) incubation of plasma membranes from old animals with lecithin liposomes, which lowered their cholesterol levels, partially abolished the defect in IRK activation; and (c) Triton extracts of liver membranes prepared from old rats did not interfere with the activation of IRK derived from young controls. Additionally, non-membrane components did contribute to the development of this defect. We observed a significant (approximately 30\%) (P \&lt; 0.001, n = 18) elevation of cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity directed against the beta subunit of the insulin receptor in livers of old rats. No such elevation of PTP activity could be demonstrated with synthetic substrates. Our findings are consistent with a model in which increased membrane viscosity as well as enhancement of a cytosolic PTP activity both markedly inhibit the activation in vivo of the hepatic IRK in old animals.},

We demonstrate efficient photoswitching and single-molecule super-resolution imaging for various fluorophore-phalloidin conjugates in aqueous buffer without the addition of further chemicals.

  abstract = {The surface reactions of electrolytes with a silicon anode in lithium ion cells have been investigated. The investigation utilizes two novel techniques that are enabled by the use of binder-free silicon (BF-Si) nanoparticle anodes. The first method, transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, allows straightforward analysis of the BF-Si solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The second method utilizes multi-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of D2O extracts from the cycled anodes. The TEM and NMR data are complemented by XPS and FTIR data, which are routinely used for SEI studies. Coin cells (BF-Si/Li) were cycled in electrolytes containing LiPF6 salt and ethylene carbonate or fluoroethylene carbonate solvent. Capacity retention was significantly better for cells cycled with LiPF6/FEC electrolyte than for cells cycled with LiPF6/EC electrolyte. Our unique combination of techniques establishes that for LiPF6/EC electrolyte the BF-Si SEI continuously grows during the first 20 cycles and the SEI becomes integrated with the BF-Si nanoparticles. The SEI predominantly contains lithium ethylene dicarbonate, LiF, and LixSiOy. BF-Si electrodes cycled with LiPF6/FEC electrolyte have a different behavior; the BF-Si nanoparticles remain relatively distinct from the SEI. The SEI predominantly contains LiF, LixSiOy, and an insoluble polymeric species.},

The depolymerization processes was tested at 180, 190 and 210 °C, and two molar ratios of PET:TEG (1:1.3 and 1:2.6), the amount of catalyst used was fxed at 1\% in relation to PET, the best experiment of PET glycolysis was found at 190 °C during two hours in a mass relation PET:TEG 1:1.3. All products were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the behavior of the reaction rate was studied for the best experiment by measuring the amount of degraded PET at different glycolysis time. The degradation of PET was favored with the use of ABEN, which accelerates the reaction, obtaining oligomers in the absence of an organic solvent or reaction medium, this is the most efcient catalyst found so far. The oligomers were obtained with molecular weight between 900 and 1500 g mol-1 depending on the reaction time, 60 min was the less time of the total glycolysis of PET. Also was found that the molecular weight of the oligomers increased along the glycolysis, due to the recombination with TEG and ethylene glycol produced in degradation.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive knowledge over the shape of nanomaterials is a critical factor in designing devices with desired functions. Due to this reason, systematic efforts have been made to synthesize materials of diverse shape in the nanoscale regime. Anisotropic nanomaterials are a class of materials in which their properties are direction-dependent and more than one structural parameter is needed to describe them. Their unique and fine-tuned physical and chemical properties make them ideal candidates for devising new applications. In addition, the assembly of ordered one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) arrays of anisotropic nanoparticles brings novel properties into the resulting system, which would be entirely different from the properties of individual nanoparticles. This review presents an overview of current research in the area of anisotropic nanomaterials in general and noble metal nanoparticles in particular. We begin with an introduction to the advancements in this area followed by general aspects of the growth of anisotropic nanoparticles. Then we describe several important synthetic protocols for making anisotropic nanomaterials, followed by a summary of their assemblies, and conclude with major applications.},

Advantages of the chemical recycling of PET, the theoretical basis of the ester bond cleavage, and a wide spectrum of degrading agents and final products are presented. Chemical processes applied in polymer recycling are divided into six groups: methanolysis, glycolysis, hydrolysis, ammonolysis, aminolysis, and other methods. Numerous possibilities for the utilization of waste PET as a very useful raw chemical material are described on the basis of literature. A comparison of chemical recycling methods is carried out. The following aspects were taken into consideration: (i) flexibility in utilizing a variety of waste types, (ii) conditions necessary for degradation including safety requirements, (iii) economic aspects, and (iv) product versatility. A total of 108 references including 46 patents are cited in this paper.},

  abstract = {A single-step, extrusion-based process to depolymerize poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been investigated. The depolymerization is effected by reacting ethylene glycol (EG) with the high molecular weight polymer (glycolysis). The ethylene glycol causes chain scission by attacking the ester linkages along the polymer backbone. The objective is to recover purified low molecular weight oligomers of bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) for repolymerization. A key feature of this process is that it employs the use of a twin-screw extruder as a reactor. The twin-screw extruder conveys the polymer and continuously creates a fresh surface area that facilitates penetration of the depolymerizing agent into the polymer. This research could play a role in reducing the considerable amount of bottle-grade PET resin that is manufactured from virgin materials, resulting in a significant environmental and economic impact. Results of glycolysis experiments on a Leistritz 34 mm counter-rotating twin-screw extruder have been characterized by substantially faster depolymerization rates than typical batch glycolysis reactions, shortening reaction times from hours to minutes. Oligomers with number-average degrees of polymerization (DPn) as low as 13 (Mn = 2,500) can be produced continuously from the starting bottle-grade PET resin (DPn = 102 and Mn = 20,000) in residence times of just 10 minutes. By changing operating conditions, e.g. feed rate and EG:PET ratio, the DPn of the final product can be controlled at essentially atmospheric pressure.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence of 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-6-propionylnaphthalene dyes Badan and Prodan is quenched by tryptophan in Brij 58 micelles as well as in two cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP102, CYP119) with Badan covalently attached to a cysteine residue. Formation of nonemissive complexes between a dye molecule and tryptophan accounts for about 76\% of the fluorescence intensity quenching in micelles, the rest is due to diffusive encounters. In the absence of tryptophan, fluorescence of Badan-labeled cytochromes decays with triexponential kinetics characterized by lifetimes of about 100 ps, 700−800 ps, and 3 ns. Site mutation of a histidine residue in the vicinity of the Badan label by tryptophan results in shortening of all three decay lifetimes. The relative amplitude of the fastest component increases at the expense of the two slower ones. The average quenching rate constants are 4.5 × 108 s−1 (CYP102) and 3.7 × 108 s−1 (CYP119), at 288 K. Cyclic voltammetry of Prodan in MeCN shows a reversible reduction peak at −1.85 V vs NHE that becomes chemically irreversible and shifts positively upon addition of water. A quasireversible reduction at −0.88 V was observed in an aqueous buffer (pH 7.3). The excited-state reduction potential of Prodan (and Badan) is estimated to vary from about +0.6 V (vs NHE) in polar aprotic media (MeCN) to approximately +1.6 V in water. Tryptophan quenching of Badan/Prodan fluorescence in CYPs and Brij 58 micelles is exergonic by ≤0.5 V and involves tryptophan oxidation by excited Badan/Prodan, coupled with a fast reaction between the reduced dye and water. Photoreduction is a new quenching mechanism for 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-6-propionylnaphthalene dyes that are often used as solvatochromic polarity probes, FRET donors and acceptors, as well as reporters of solvation dynamics.},

The focus of this work is set on the generation of proper thermodynamic ensembles at a quantum chemical level for conformers, but similar procedures for protonation states, tautomerism and non-covalent complex geometries are also discussed. The conformational ensembles consisting of all significantly populated minimum energy structures normally form the basis of further, mostly DFT computational work, such as the calculation of spectra or macroscopic properties. By using basic quantum chemical methods, electronic effects or possible bond breaking/formation are accounted for and a very reasonable initial energetic ranking of the candidate structures is obtained. Due to the huge computational speedup gained by the fast low-cost quantum chemical methods, overall short computation times even for systems with hundreds of atoms (typically drug-sized molecules) are achieved. Furthermore, specialized applications, such as sampling with implicit solvation models or constrained conformational sampling for transition-states, metal-, surface-, or noncovalently bound complexes are discussed, opening many possible applications in modern computational chemistry and drug discovery. The procedures have been implemented in a freely available computer code called CREST, that makes use of the fast and reliable GFN               n               -xTB methods.},

However, there has been no study on the direct observation of the switching process with the aid of a microwave signal input. We report a time-resolved imaging study of magnetization reversal in patterned magnetic structures under the influence of a field pulse with microwave assistance. The microwave frequency is varied to demonstrate the effect of resonant microwave-assisted switching. We observe that the switching process is dominated by spin wave dynamics generated as a result of magnetic instabilities in the structures and identify the frequencies that are most dominant in magnetization reversal.},

  abstract = {As molecular electronics advances, efficient and reliable computation procedures are required for the simulation of the atomic structures of actual devices, as well as for the prediction of their electronic properties. Density-functional theory (DFT) has had widespread success throughout chemistry and solid-state physics, and it offers the possibility of fulfilling these roles. In its modern form it is an empirically parameterized approach that cannot be extended toward exact solutions in a prescribed way, ab initio. Thus, it is essential that the weaknesses of the method be identified and likely shortcomings anticipated in advance. We consider four known systematic failures of modern DFT: dispersion, charge transfer, extended π conjugation, and bond cleavage. Their ramifications for molecular electronics applications are outlined and we suggest that great care is required when using modern DFT to partition charge flow across electrode-molecule junctions, screen applied electric fields, position molecular orbitals with respect to electrode Fermi energies, and in evaluating the distance dependence of through-molecule conductivity. The causes of these difficulties are traced to errors inherent in the types of density functionals in common use, associated with their inability to treat very long-range electron correlation effects. Heuristic enhancements of modern DFT designed to eliminate individual problems are outlined, as are three new schemes that each represent significant departures from modern DFT implementations designed to provide a priori improvements in at least one and possible all problem areas. Finally, fully semiempirical schemes based on both Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham theory are described that, in the short term, offer the means to avoid the inherent problems of modern DFT and, in the long term, offer competitive accuracy at dramatically reduced computational costs.},

Following intramolecular twisting, the TICT state returns to the ground state either through red-shifted emission or by nonradiative relaxation. The emission properties are potentially environment-dependent, which makes TICT-based fluorophores ideal sensors for solvents, (micro)viscosity, and chemical species. Recently, several TICT-based materials have been discovered to become fluorescent upon aggregation. Furthermore, various recent studies in organic optoelectronics, non-linear optics and solar energy conversions utilised the concept of TICT to modulate the electronic-state mixing and coupling on charge transfer states. This review presents a compact overview of the latest developments in TICT research, from a materials chemistry point of view.},

  abstract = {This work presents a primer on ‘‘How to Read and Apply Phase Diagrams’’ in the current environment of powerful thermodynamic software packages. Advanced aspects in that context are also covered. It is a brief guide into using this cornerstone of knowledge in materials science and engineering and offers assistance in the proper interpretation of results obtained from stateof-the-art Calphad-type thermodynamic calculations. Starting from the very basics it explains the reading of unary, binary and ternary phase diagrams, including liquidus projections, isothermal and vertical phase diagram sections. Application examples are directly derived from these phase diagrams of Fe, Cu-Ni, Mg-Al, and Mg-Al-Zn. The use of stable and metastable phase diagrams and appropriate choices of state variables are explained for the relevant Fe-C and Fe-C-Si systems. The most useful concept of zero-phase fraction lines in phase diagram sections of multicomponent systems is made clear by coming back to the Cu-Ni and Mg-Al-Zn systems. Thermodynamic solidification simulation using the Scheil approximation in comparison to the equilibrium case is covered in context of multicomponent multiphase solidification and exemplified for Mg-Al-Zn alloys. The generic approach is directly applicable for all inorganic materials, but exemplified in this concise work for a small selection of metallic systems to highlight the interdependences among the phase diagrams. The embedded application examples for real material systems and various materials processes also emphasize the use of phase diagrams for the path from initial off-equilibrium state towards equilibrium.},

Transesterification reaction of diethylterephthalate with ethanol is investigated as a model system by using the B3LYP level of theory, and Sb(OEt)3, Ge(OEt)4 and Ti(OEt)4 are adopted as model catalysts. We found that the metal center of metal alkoxides coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the ester, and the alkoxy oxygen atom of alkoxy ligands attacks to the carbonyl carbon atom of the ester to form the four-centered transition state. The activation energy for tetraethoxy titanium catalyzed reaction in vacuo is 15.47 kcal/mol; this is comparable to the experimental result of 11.2 kcal/mol for poly(butylene terephthalate)/Ti(OBu) 4.

  abstract = {Recent advances in protein design have opened avenues for the creation of artificial enzymes needed for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications. However, designing efficient enzymes remains an unrealized ambition, as the design must incorporate a catalytic apparatus specific for the desired reaction. Here we present a de novo design approach to evolve a minimal carbonic anhydrase mimic. We followed a step-by-step design of first folding the main chain followed by sequence variation for substrate binding and catalysis. To optimize the fold, we designed an abb protein based on a Zn-finger. We then inverse-designed the sequences to provide stability to the fold along with flexibility of linker regions to optimize Zn binding and substrate hydrolysis. The resultant peptides were synthesized and assessed for Zn and substrate binding affinity by fluorescence and ITC followed by evaluation of catalytic efficiency with UV-based enzyme kinetic assays. We were successful in mimicking carbonic anhydrase activity in a peptide of twenty two residues, using p-nitrophenyl acetate as a CO2 surrogate. Although our design had modest activity, being a simple structure is an advantage for further improvement in efficiency. Our approach opens a way forward to evolving an efficient biocatalyst for any industrial reaction of interest.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen has been investigated for decades as a temporary alloying element to refine the microstructure of Ti–6Al–4V, and is now being used in a novel powder metallurgy method known as “hydrogen sintering and phase transformation”. Pseudo-binary phase diagrams of (Ti–6Al–4V)–xH have been studied and developed, but are not well established due to methodological limitations. In this paper, in situ studies of phase transformations during hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of (Ti–6Al–4V)–xH alloys were conducted using high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The eutectoid phase transformation of b M a + d was observed in the (Ti–6Al–4V)–xH alloy via in situ synchrotron XRD at 211 °C with a hydrogen concentration of 37.5 at.\% (measured using TGA–DSC). The relationships of hydrogen composition to partial pressure and temperature were investigated in the temperature range 450–900 °C. Based on these results, a partial pseudo-binary phase diagram of (Ti–6Al–4V)–xH is proposed for hydrogen compositions up to 60 at.\% in the temperature range 100–900 °C. Using the data collected in real time under controlled parameters of temperature, composition and hydrogen partial pressure, this work characterizes relevant phase transformations and microstructural evolution for practical titanium–hydrogen technologies of Ti–6Al–4V.},

  abstract = {The heterogeneity on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) kinetics between a labeled fluorophore and an amino acid residue has been extensively studied in biopolymers. However in aqueous solutions, the heterogeneity on PET kinetics between a fluorophore and a quencher has rarely been reported. Herein, we selected four commonly used fluorophores, such as tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), Rhodamine B (RhB), Alexa fluor 546 (Alexa546), and Atto655, and studied their respective PET kinetics in 50 mM tryptophan solutions with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to explore the structural heterogeneity in their corresponding collision complexes. We measured the decay of the first excited electronic state of respective fluorophore with and without 50 mM tryptophan in aqueous solutions, and derived the charge separation rate in their corresponding collision complexes. We found that the PET process of all selected fluorophores in 50 mM tryptophan solutions has two charge separation rates, which indicates that the relevant states in the collision complex between respective fluorophore and tryptophan have strong structural heterogeneity. These femtosecond PET measurements are in agreement with Vaiana’s molecular dynamics simulation (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 14564). In addition, with the obtained PET kinetic parameters, we derived the relative brightness of the collision complex between respective fluorophore and tryptophan, which are important parameters for the PET based fluorescence correlation spectroscopy study involving these fluorophores in biopolymers.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in computational chemistry has enabled numerous advances previously out of reach due to the computational complexity of traditional electronic-structure methods. One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation are combined to characterize the interaction of two organic fluorescent dyes, rhodamine 6G (R6G) and an oxazine derivative (MR121), with the amino acid tryptophan in aqueous solution. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching experiments reveal the formation of essentially nonfluorescent ground-state dye/Trp complexes. The MD simulations are used to elucidate the molecular interaction geometries involved. The MD-derived probability distribution of the distance r between the centers of geometry of the dye and quencher ring systems, P(r), extends to higher distances for R6G than for MR121 due to population in the R6G/Trp system of fluorescent interaction geometries between Trp and the phenyl ring and ester group of the dye. The consequence of this is the experimental finding that under the conditions used in the simulations about 25\% of the R6G dye is fluorescent in comparison with 10\% of the MR121. Combining the above findings allows determination of the “quenching distance”, r*, above which no quenching occurs. r* is found to be very similar (∼5.5 Å) for both dye/Trp systems, corresponding to close to van der Waals contact. Both experimental dynamic Stern-Volmer analysis and the MD trajectories demonstrate that the main determinant of the fluorescence intensity is static quenching. The approach presented is likely to be useful in the structural interpretation of data obtained from fluorescent conjugates commonly used for monitoring the binding and dynamics of biomolecular systems.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of polyesterification of the glycolyzed PET waste with adipic acid is reported. Glycolysis of PET waste was carried out with ethylene glycol at three different ratios of PET waste to glycol. The glycolyzed products could be readily polyesterified by reacting with adipic acid, to give polyester polyols with low acid number. Kinetics of polyesterification of the glycolyzed product made from 62.5\% ethylene glycol (EG) and 37.5\% waste were investigated further at different hydroxyl to carboxyl ratios. Reaction conditions were nonisothermal, comparable to the industrial process scheme consisting of two isothermal regions at 170° and 200°C. The kinetic results of the polyesterification of glycolyzed PET waste are compared to the polyesterification of pure diols, namely ethylene glycol and bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) with adipic acid. The reactions follow second-order kinetics at 170°C and the rate of polyesterification of the mixed diol system from PET waste lies intermediate between those of the pure diols, namely, EG and BHET. Ethylene glycol exhibited the highest reactivity. At 200°C the kinetic plots of the mixed diols from PET waste were nonlinear, and thus the reaction may not follow second-order kinetics. The nonlinearity is explained in terms of the different reactivities of the different diol species in the reaction mixture. The polyester polyols, when cured with polymeric 4,4 diphenyl methane diisocyanates, gave polyurethane rigid foams and elastomers. Copyright © 1988 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Anisotropy, or alternatively, isotropy of phase transformations extensively exist in a number of solid-state materials, with performance depending on the three-dimensional transformation features. Fundamental insights into internal chemical phase evolution allow manipulating materials with desired functionalities, and can be developed via real-time multi-dimensional imaging methods. Here, we report a five-dimensional imaging method to track phase transformation as a function of charging time in individual lithium iron phosphate battery cathode particles during delithiation. The electrochemically driven phase transformation is initially anisotropic with a preferred boundary migration direction, but becomes isotropic as delithiation proceeds further. We also observe the expected two-phase coexistence throughout the entire charging process. We expect this five-dimensional imaging method to be broadly applicable to problems in energy, materials, environmental and life sciences.},

In this review, we focus on not only how machine learning is employed to speed up such excited-state simulations but also how this branch of artificial intelligence can be used to advance this exciting research field in all its aspects. Discussed applications of machine learning for excited states include excited-state dynamics simulations, static calculations of absorption spectra, as well as many others. In order to put these studies into context, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques. Since the latter are mostly based on quantum chemistry calculations, we also provide a short introduction into excited-state electronic structure methods and approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and describe tricks and problems when using them in machine learning for excited states of molecules.},

Here, we report the discovery of a stimuli-responsive molecular rotor, the rotational speed of which in the slow-to-fast range could be modulated to at least four stages triggered by acid/base and metal cations. The rotor itself rotates rapidly at ambient or elevated temperature but displays a restricted rotation after deprotonation due to the produced intramolecular electrostatic repulsion. Subsequent addition of Li               +               or Na               +               cations introduces an electrostatic bridge to stabilize the transition state of the deprotonated rotor, thus giving a cation-radius-dependent acceleration of the rotation to render the rotor running at a mid-speed. All the stimuli are highly reversible. Our studies provide a conceptual approach for constructing multistage rotational-speed-changing molecular~rotors, and further, the practical nanomachines.},

  abstract = {Kohn−Sham density functional theory is widely used for applications of electronic structure theory in chemistry, materials science, and condensed-matter physics, but the accuracy depends on the quality of the exchangecorrelation functional. Here, we present a new local exchangecorrelation functional called MN15-L that predicts accurate results for a broad range of molecular and solid-state properties including main-group bond energies, transition metal bond energies, reaction barrier heights, noncovalent interactions, atomic excitation energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, total atomic energies, hydrocarbon thermochemistry, and lattice constants of solids. The MN15-L functional has the same mathematical form as a previous meta-nonseparable gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional, MN12-L, but it is improved because we optimized it against a larger database, designated 2015A, and included smoothness restraints; the optimization has a much better representation of transition metals. The mean unsigned error on 422 chemical energies is 2.32 kcal/mol, which is the best among all tested functionals, with or without nonlocal exchange. The MN15-L functional also provides good results for test sets that are outside the training set. A key issue is that the functional is local (no nonlocal exchange or nonlocal correlation), which makes it relatively economical for treating large and complex systems and solids. Another key advantage is that medium-range correlation energy is built in so that one does not need to add damped dispersion by molecular mechanics in order to predict accurate noncovalent binding energies. We believe that the MN15-L functional should be useful for a wide variety of applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and molecular biology.},

In this paper, an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of ESP is proposed. It regroups the expression in terms of primitive Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) with identical angular momentum types and nuclei centers. Each term is calculated using a computerized optimized code. This algorithm was integrated into the wavefunction analysis program Multiwfn and was tested on several large systems. In the cases of dopamine and remdesivir, the performance of this algorithm was comparable to or better than some popular state-of-the-art codes. For meta1–organic framework-5, where the number of GTOs and ESP points is 4840 and 259\,262, respectively, our code could finish the evaluation in 1874 seconds on ordinary hardware. It also exhibits good parallelization scaling. The source code of this algorithm is freely available and can become a useful tool for computational chemists.},

The present short communication illustrates how to conduct multi-element X-ray movie imaging in a synchrotron facility solely by placing a micro-pinhole in front of a visible-light complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. It has been found that the CMOS camera can resolve X-ray fluorescence spectra when it is specially operated. In this work, a spatial resolution of ∼15\hspace{0.25em}µm was achieved. In the X-ray movie, a movie frame acquisition time of 2\hspace{0.25em}min and a spatial resolution of ∼50\hspace{0.25em}µm were simultaneously achieved.
